    Subject: Command Injection Vulnerability Report
    <br><br>
    Dear [Website Owner/Administrator],
    <br><br>
    I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a potential security vulnerability that I discovered on your website. This vulnerability is related to Command Injection, which could pose a significant risk to the security and integrity of your website and its users.
    <br><br>
    Description of the Vulnerability:
    Through the upload section of your website, I found that it is possible to execute arbitrary commands using the CMD (Command Prompt) by appending them to the URL query parameters. For example, by using the following format: <code>https://ncpd.gov.sa/uploads?cmd=ls</code>, the "ls" command is executed in the CMD, displaying a directory listing.
    <br><br>
    Potential Risks:
    Command Injection allows unauthorized individuals to execute arbitrary commands on your web server. This poses serious security risks, including but not limited to:
    <br><br>
    1. Unauthorized access to sensitive data and files on your server.
    <br>
    2. Execution of malicious commands that could compromise your server's functionality.
    <br>
    3. Potential exposure of user data and confidential information.
